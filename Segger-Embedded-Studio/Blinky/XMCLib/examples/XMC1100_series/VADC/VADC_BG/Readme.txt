Description of example project
==============================
This example project depicts usage of VADC driver with the background source.

Hardware Setup
===============
XMC1100 Bootkit (No other satellite board required)

How to test the application
============================

The VADC measures the voltage on P2.0 and store the result in the "result" variable.
The measurement is continuously.
