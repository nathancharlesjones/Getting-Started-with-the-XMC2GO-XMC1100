Description of example project
==============================
In this example, the DMA is used to feed the Flexible CRC Engine (FCE) to calculate the CRC-32 on a fictitious frame of data.
The CRC-32 of a frame of 256 words is calculated. If the calculated CRC matches the expected one, then the LED1 will be turned on, otherwise the LED1 will blink.
